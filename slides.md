## Navigate vertically

_hint: press <kbd>↓</kdb>_<!-- .element: class="small" -->

--

This slide appears below the first slide

_hint: press <kbd>→</kdb>_<!-- .element: class="small" -->

---

## Navigate horizontally

This slide appears to the right of the first slide

---

Go Big<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

---

Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to see overview

--

Press <kbd>S</kbd> to open speaker view.

You can even include notes that only the presenter can see!

<!-- Presenter notes are specified by anything written below a line that starts with "NOTE: " -->

NOTE: This is only visible to the presenter.

Drag this tab to a different window or screenshare the other tab. When you change slides on this presenter-view tab, the other tab with audience focused tabs will change as well.
